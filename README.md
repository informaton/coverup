# Cover up

## Background

I opened Skype on my Mac OSX and saw that Microsoft was now placing adds directly into the program.  I find the razors distracting and want to cover them up.

## Purpose

A draggrable cover that goes over a portion of your software and then tracks with it as it moves around the screen so that you don't have to see it any longer.

## Options

1. Blur over background.  Different blur options available.
2. Flat colored cover.
3. Pattern cover.
4. Image.
5. Changing image; slide show.
